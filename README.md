# Weather Forecast Web Application.

<p> A minimalist asynchronous weather application. </p>

#### Deployed at: http://alpha-weatherapp.herokuapp.com/

#### Help: 
<p> You can use this web app to find out the weather of any place in real time. Just type in the name of the place in the search bar and see the magic happen. </p>

### Features include: 
<br>
<ol>
  <li> Complete location of the searched place. </li>
  <li> Local time of the place, Date and the present weather forecast in that region. </li>
  <li> Autocomplete feature powered by Google Places API (sometimes it won't work due to API traffic or daily API calls limit or a number of   other reasons) and Weather based real-time icons (if available). </li>
</ol>
